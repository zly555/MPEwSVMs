Description: Implements linear algorithms for nonparametric multiclass 
    probability estimation using weighted Support Vector Machines (SVMs). 
    The package provides efficient methods for estimating class 
    probabilities in a multiclass framework by leveraging specialized 
    weighting schemes. Based on the methodology in Zeng and Zhang (2022) 
    "Linear Algorithms for Robust and Scalable Nonparametric Multiclass Probability Estimation" <arXiv:2205.12460>.
